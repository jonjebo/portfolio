            <img class="image" src="./Assets/images/FBFD9AA8-8ED2-4925-89EF-2D664CE7D1E2.JPG" alt="Photo from Niagra Falls" width=48%> Good morning, afternoon, or night to you! My name is Jonathan Dangelo and I am currently writing my first "About
            Me" page.
            <br> I currently live in sunny SoCal, but am originally from a small farming town in Ohio where I was born and raised.
            Once I graduated high school I moved to Colorado where I spent a few years in Vail snowboarding and enjoying
            life! When I was there I had some of best experiences of my life and made some of the best friends I've ever
            had. Vail is a place that gets visitors from all over the world and every year I made new friends from other
            countries. I do not regret one day that I spent there.</p>
          <p> Then my world changed and I decided that I wanted to gain my Bachelors from CSU in Fort Collins, Colorado. I then
            spent the next five years there going to school and getting used to the change of pace from Vail. I made many
            more friends and had many nights nights out with friends over beers. The 5 years in Fort Collins were some of
            the best I've had as well because I loved the town town and the people I was surrounded by. Colorado has become
            much more fast paced since I have left a couple years ago. Around the time I moved away many people started moving
            to Colorado and have changed the environment. It is much larger now and there are many more people.</p>
          <p> I have traveled over half of this beautiful country and a few countries across the world and my traveling has not
            finshed yet. I am soon to have a baby boy and hope that we will be able to continue my traveling together so
            that both of us can experince the world that we live in together. I still haven't found the state that I want
            to call home, but I feel I am getting closer. It makes me sad to leave my friends and move to new places, but
            it also allows me to gain new friends that I would never have me otherwise.</p>
          <p> Thank You for reading a little bit about me and where I come from! Best of wishes on your future endevors!</p>
